             | Abstract: \<font size=\"3\" color=\"\#808080\"\>
We describe the background and an analytical framework for a mathematical optimization model for home
energy management systems (HEMS) to manage electricity demand by efficiently shifting electricity loads of households from peak times to off-peak times.
We illustrate the flexibility of the model by modularizing various available technologies such as plug-in electric vehicles, battery storage, and automatic windows.
First, the analysis shows that the end-user can accrue economic benefits by shifting consumer loads away from higher-priced periods.
Specifically, we assessed the most likely sources of value to be derived from demand response technologies.
Therefore, wide adoption of such modeling could create significant cost savings for consumers.
Second, the findings are promising for the further development of more intelligent HEMS in the residential sector.
Third, we formulated a smart grid valuation framework that is helpful for interpreting the model's results concerning the efficiency of current smart appliances and their respective prices.
Finally, we explain the model's benefits and its policy implications, the major concerns when the model is applied in the real world, and the possible future areas that can be explored.

#             | Abstract: \<font size=\"3\" color=\"\#808080\"\>
#Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has become a critical research topic worldwide in the past several years. Among many aspects for CPS research and development, the “security” issue has been identified as a core of the crosscutting strategic challenges that are essential to the success of all sectors by the CPS Steering Group of the Federal Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD). The joint behavior of the “cyber” and “physical” elements of the CPS makes the security aspect plays an essential role in the operation of the entire system. In this talk, I will take the energy system as an example of the CPS, and present our recent research methods and results in the field toward a secure and smart power grid.
