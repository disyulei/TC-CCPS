The continuous scaling of integrated circuit (IC) technologies has been driving the semiconductor industry for several decades.
Nowadays, even though the scaling of mainstream CMOS technologies is starting to slow down,
the field of VLSI circuits and systems continues its remarkable growth with numerous opportunities along two complementary avenues:
(1) development of post-silicon devices, circuits and systems (e.g., carbon nanotube, graphene, memristor, etc.),
and (2) discovery of emerging application domains (e.g., biomedical electronics, internet of things, etc.).
The VLSI Circuits and Systems Letter, published twice a year, aims to report recent advances in VLSI technology, education and opportunities and, consequently, grow the research and education activities in the area.

This letter is affiliated with the Technical Committee on VLSI (TCVLSI) under the IEEE Computer Society.
TCVLSI covers the design methodologies for advanced VLSI circuit and systems, including digital circuits and systems, analog and radio-frequency circuits, as well as mixed-signal circuits and systems.
The emphasis of TCVLSI falls on integrating the design, computer-aided design, fabrication, application, and business aspects of VLSI while encompassing both hardware and software.
