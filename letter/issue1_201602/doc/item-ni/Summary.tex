\section{Summary}

Machine condition monitoring (MCM) for large scale Industrial Internet of Things deployments will be critical for enterprises owning such systems.
The need to eliminate catastrophic downtimes due to unexpected breakdowns and unnecessary maintenance costs has made condition monitoring critical for asset utilization and productivity across diverse industries.
It has become imperative for such MCM systems to incorporate a sound management strategy to aggregate the data, conduct diagnostic analytics about the condition of the system, and facilitate predictive maintenance to reduce downtimes and maximize efficiency.
According to a September 2015 report from Frost \& Sullivan on Global Big Data Analytics Market for Test \& Measurement, product development costs can be reduced by almost 25\%, operating costs can be reduced by almost 20\%, and maintenance costs can be reduced by 50\% if big data analytics is applied for testing \cite{NITrendWatch2016}. 
In this paper, we discussed the roles of enterprise MCMs and presented a representative tool, NI InsightCM\textsuperscript{TM}, which has been used for controlling and monitoring large scale distributed systems like a modern power generation network. 
To push the boundaries and maintain a competitive edge, the engineering community must provide MCM tools that find new correlations based on the monitored data to predict key future behaviors and even automatically take preventative actions with little human supervision.
%In the near future, the role of MCM may not be just limited to condition monitoring but also encompass automatic preventative actions based on monitored data.
