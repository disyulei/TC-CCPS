\section{Case Study}

NI InsightCM\textsuperscript{TM} has been widely used across multiple industrial domains including traditional power generation, oil and gas, renewable power generation, transportation and aerospace, heavy equipment, and manufacturing. Next we will provide a few specific examples.

Condition monitoring is widely used to monitor industrial machinery to help predict failure and better schedule maintenance, saving time and money. National Instruments provides products that help companies do this with more flexibility than ever before in test setups, portable diagnostics, and remote, distributed monitoring. \cite{MCM_UC_NI}
